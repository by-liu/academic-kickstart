I am a researcher and engineer in Artificial Intelligence with mixed academia and industry experience of about 10 years. Currently, I am a technical leader of computer vision in kujiale.com, which is a unicorn startup company in the field of clould computing, 3D interior design and 3D visulization.
Besides exploring the edge of artificial intelligence, I also have some interest in social sciences and humanities because of the curiosity of our world. Maybe I will post some of my thoughts in this website. My hobbies are sports and travel.
